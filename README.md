#### APP README


* You can either click on the provided buttons or use the keyboard Keys to capture your desired inputs
* The Calculator will display both the answer and previous calculations performed after the last Clear    Data operation.
* No Calculation is performed if you press the Equals button or the Enter key if the input is empty.
* Clicking the Del button or the Backspace key will delete the previously entered digit.

#### ToDo: 

* Implement number formatting so that the calculation results are displayed with correct decimal formatting
* PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ONLY BUG FIXING - Pressing the Enter key in Production Environment does not always produce desired results, sometimes it clears data instead of performing the required calculations. It's been difficult to fix this Bug as I can not reproduce it in my Development Environment. I'm yet to finish troubleshooting this bug. 
    * The Equals Key and Button are working perfectly and users are encouraged to use these instead.
